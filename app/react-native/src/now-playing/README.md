# Audio Player Implementation - Step 2

## What's Implemented

✅ **Basic audio player with play/pause functionality**
- Custom `useAudioPlayer` hook for managing audio state
- `AudioControls` component with play/pause button
- Integration with the now-playing screen
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Mock implementation ready for `react-native-track-player` integration

## Current Features

- **Loading State**: Shows spinner while audio is being prepared
- **Play/Pause Toggle**: Single button that toggles between play and pause states
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows current playback status (Playing/Paused)
- **Accessible**: Proper accessibility labels and roles
- **Tested**: Full test suite with loading, interaction, and state management tests

## File Structure

```
src/
├── library/
│   ├── hooks/
│   │   └── useAudioPlayer.ts      # Audio player hook (mock implementation)
│   └── components/
│       └── AudioControls.tsx      # Audio controls component
├── now-playing/
│   ├── now-playing-screen.tsx     # Main screen with audio player
│   └── now-playing-screen.test.tsx # Tests for audio functionality
└── assets/

        └── chapter-01.mp3         # Test audio file
```

## Next Steps (When react-native-track-player is Added)

1. **Install the dependency**: `npm install react-native-track-player`
2. **Update the hook**: Replace mock implementation in `useAudioPlayer.ts` with real TrackPlayer calls
3. **Add platform setup**: iOS background mode capabilities, Android service setup
4. **Update file paths**: Use proper require() syntax for audio files
5. **Test on device**: Verify actual audio playback works

## Mock vs Real Implementation

Currently using a mock implementation that simulates:
- Loading states with setTimeout
- Play/pause state management
- Console logging for debugging

When the real library is added, the hook will use:
- `TrackPlayer.setupPlayer()` for initialization
- `TrackPlayer.add()` for loading tracks
- `TrackPlayer.play()/pause()` for controls
- Event listeners for state changes

## Testing

All tests pass and cover:
- Component rendering
- Loading states
- User interactions
- State transitions
- Accessibility

Run tests with: `npm test -- --testPathPattern=now-playing-screen.test.tsx`
