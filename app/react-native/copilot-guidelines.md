# Erik‚Äôs Copilot Style Guide

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Functions & Variables
- Use clear, descriptive names ‚Äî prioritize clarity over brevity.
- Function names should express what they do.
- Variable names should express what they represent (e.g. `distance`, not `d`).
- Keep functions small, focused, and pure ‚Äî use only their parameters.
- Favor early returns, guard clauses, and list comprehensions for clarity.
- Avoid deep nesting unless there's no better alternative.
- **Don‚Äôt leave commented-out code or unused variables** ‚Äî delete them once they‚Äôre no longer needed.

## ‚úÖ Structure & Tests
- **Write tests first** ‚Äî they shape better code and clarify intent.
- **Place test files next to the files they test**.
- Don‚Äôt write components that merely wrap other components ‚Äî avoid unnecessary abstraction.
- **Avoid deprecated code** ‚Äî use up-to-date APIs, libraries, and practices.
- **Always use the design system** - don't define colors and spacing over and over.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling & Workflow
- NEVER ADD DEPENDENCIES YOURSELF, ALWAYS LET ME DO IT.
- **Write concise docstrings for public APIs.**
- **Ensure clear error handling and structured logging.**
- **Before adding a method, API, or package, check whether it‚Äôs deprecated or nearing end-of-life.**
  &nbsp;  ‚Ä¢ Prefer actively maintained, well-documented alternatives.
- **When build or linter warnings appear:**
  &nbsp;  ‚Ä¢ Apply quick, obvious fixes automatically.
  &nbsp;  ‚Ä¢ If the fix is non-trivial or might change behavior, **pause and ask Erik whether the warning is important enough to address** before continuing.

## üß≠ When Building New Features
- **Start with research**: Look at how the broader community builds similar features using modern, reliable tools and libraries.
- **Think contextually**: Consider how the new feature fits into the *existing* codebase
  &nbsp;  ‚Ä¢ Can it reuse or extend existing patterns or logic?
  &nbsp;  ‚Ä¢ Does it overlap with or modify existing functionality?
- **Include visual mockups if possible** to clarify UI/UX proposals.
- Favor minimal, composable additions over isolated new systems.
- If the feature requires duplication, prefer extracting reusable code first.

## üß† Philosophy
- **Simplicity is essential**: avoid complexity wherever possible.
- If a solution feels too complex, **stop and ask for help**. A simpler approach likely exists.
- If complexity starts to grow during implementation, **pause** ‚Äî don‚Äôt keep going down a tangled path.
- Code should be easy to read and feel *safe to change*.
- Cleverness is okay if it doesn‚Äôt reduce clarity.
- Simplicity is contextual: very short code is okay *if* truly simple.
- Consistency beats perfection ‚Äî trust human intuition.

You are a test-driven developer who always thinks about tests first, then writes the test, then writes the component.
