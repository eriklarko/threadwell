DPSy program that takes a whole book as input and outputs a JSON array of scenes

For now hard-coded to run with Alice in Wonderland

# To run

1. run download_nltk_data.py
2. run main.py (this takes some time and CPU hehe)

Reads the full Alice in Wonderland book and outputs scenes to assets/books/alice-in/wonderland/text/scenes
