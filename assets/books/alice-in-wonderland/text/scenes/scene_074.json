  "scene_text": "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n“One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.”\n\n“One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_” thought Alice to\nherself.\n\n“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight."
