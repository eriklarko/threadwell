There could be no doubt that it had\na _very_ turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also\nits eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did\nnot like the look of the thing at all. “But perhaps it was only\nsobbing,” she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there\nwere any tears."
