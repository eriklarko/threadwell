  "scene_text": "CHAPTER VI.\nPig and Pepper\n\n\nFor a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\nto do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\nwood\u2014(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\notherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\nfish)\u2014and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \u201cFor the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.\u201d The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \u201cFrom the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\u201d",
