Good-bye, feet!”\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m\nsure _I_ shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\nkind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.”\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They must\ngo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\npresents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice’s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”"
