Good-bye, feet!\u201d\n(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\nsight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I\nwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m\nsure _I_ shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\nmyself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2014but I must be\nkind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I\nwant to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every\nChristmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must\ngo by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending\npresents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\n     _Alice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq., Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\n     Alice\u2019s love_).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d",
