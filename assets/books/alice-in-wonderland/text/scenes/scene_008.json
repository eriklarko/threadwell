There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u201d\n(Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and\nsometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer\neither question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",
