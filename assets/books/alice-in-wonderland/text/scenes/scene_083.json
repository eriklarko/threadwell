  "scene_text": "“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n“Whoever lives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high."
