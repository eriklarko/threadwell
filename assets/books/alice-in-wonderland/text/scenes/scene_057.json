  "scene_text": "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goes Bill!”\nthen the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you by the hedge!” then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices—“Hold up his head—Brandy\nnow—Don’t choke him—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!”\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,” thought\nAlice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’m better now—but I’m\na deal too flustered to tell you—all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!”\n\n“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.\n\n“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice\ncalled out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!”"
