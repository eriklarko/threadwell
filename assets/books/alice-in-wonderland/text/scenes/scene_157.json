  "scene_text": "“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\n“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!”\n\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\n“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.\n\nThe other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\nresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\nback to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay\nwould cost them their lives.\n\nAll the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling\nwith the other players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off with\nher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the\nsoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so\nthat by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and\nall the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody\nand under sentence of execution."
