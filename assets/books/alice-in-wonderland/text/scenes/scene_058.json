  "scene_text": "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “I\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\nroof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”\n\n“A barrowful of _what?_” thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stop to\nthis,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d better not do that\nagain!” which produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. “If I eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.”"
