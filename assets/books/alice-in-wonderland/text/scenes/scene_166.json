Never heard of\nuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, I suppose?”\n\n“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “it means—to—make—anything—prettier.”\n\n“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t know what to uglify\nis, you _are_ a simpleton.”\n\nAlice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so\nshe turned to the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”\n\n“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the\nsubjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, with\nSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\nthat used to come once a week: _he_ taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\nFainting in Coils.”\n\n“What was _that_ like?” said Alice.\n\n“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said: “I’m too\nstiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”"
