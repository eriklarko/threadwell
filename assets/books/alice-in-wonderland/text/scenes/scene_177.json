I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.”\n\n“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon. “Do you\nknow why it’s called a whiting?”\n\n“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”\n\n“_It does the boots and shoes_,” the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n\n“Why, what are _your_ shoes done with?” said the Gryphon. “I mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?”\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. “They’re done with blacking, I believe.”\n\n“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n“are done with a whiting. Now you know.”\n\n“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n\n“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n“any shrimp could have told you that.”"
