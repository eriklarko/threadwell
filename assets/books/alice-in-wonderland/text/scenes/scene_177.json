I never knew so much\nabout a whiting before.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can tell you more than that, if you like,\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cDo you\nknow why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never thought about it,\u201d said Alice. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201c_It does the boots and shoes_,\u201d the Gryphon replied very solemnly.\n\nAlice was thoroughly puzzled. \u201cDoes the boots and shoes!\u201d she repeated\nin a wondering tone.\n\n\u201cWhy, what are _your_ shoes done with?\u201d said the Gryphon. \u201cI mean, what\nmakes them so shiny?\u201d\n\nAlice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her\nanswer. \u201cThey\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoots and shoes under the sea,\u201d the Gryphon went on in a deep voice,\n\u201care done with a whiting. Now you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what are they made of?\u201d Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.\n\n\u201cSoles and eels, of course,\u201d the Gryphon replied rather impatiently:\n\u201cany shrimp could have told you that.\u201d",
