The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u201d Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, \u201cand they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear\noneself speak\u2014and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you\u2019ve no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the\narch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\u201d",
