I think I may as well go in at once.\u201d And\nin she went.\n\nOnce more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\nglass table. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll manage better this time,\u201d she said to herself,\nand began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that\nled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_\u2014she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nThe Queen\u2019s Croquet-Ground\n\n\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, \u201cLook out now, Five! Don\u2019t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!\u201d",
