Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom\n(she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot\nhigh: then she walked down the little passage: and _then_—she found\nherself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds\nand the cool fountains.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\nThe Queen’s Croquet-Ground\n\n\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, “Look out now, Five! Don’t go splashing paint over me\nlike that!”"
