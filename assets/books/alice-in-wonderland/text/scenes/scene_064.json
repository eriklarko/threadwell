  "scene_text": "CHAPTER V.\nAdvice from a Caterpillar\n\n\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n“Who are _you?_” said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.”"
