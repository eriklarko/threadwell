  "scene_text": "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\nand very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\nwas not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\none elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\nStill she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\nof the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201cNow I\ncan do no more, whatever happens. What _will_ become of me?\u201d\n\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\nand she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\nseemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\nagain, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t\nalways growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\nrabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and\nyet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n_can_ have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied\nthat kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of\none! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And\nwhen I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a\nsorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more _here_.\u201d",
