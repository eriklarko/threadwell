  "scene_text": "“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in the\ncourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\nto make out who was talking.\n\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\n“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. “A nice\nmuddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!” thought Alice."
