And\nthe Gryphon added \u201cCome, let\u2019s hear some of _your_ adventures.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could tell you my adventures\u2014beginning from this morning,\u201d said\nAlice a little timidly: \u201cbut it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.\u201d\n\n\u201cExplain all that,\u201d said the Mock Turtle.\n\n\u201cNo, no! The adventures first,\u201d said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n\u201cexplanations take such a dreadful time.\u201d\n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating \u201c_You are old, Father William_,\u201d to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said \u201cThat\u2019s very curious.\u201d",
