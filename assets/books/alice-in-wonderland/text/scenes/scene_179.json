  "scene_text": "“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.\n\n“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And\nthe Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of _your_ adventures.”\n\n“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,” said\nAlice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back to yesterday,\nbecause I was a different person then.”\n\n“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatient tone:\n“explanations take such a dreadful time.”\n\nSo Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first\nsaw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first,\nthe two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\ntheir eyes and mouths so _very_ wide, but she gained courage as she\nwent on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part\nabout her repeating “_You are old, Father William_,” to the\nCaterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock\nTurtle drew a long breath, and said “That’s very curious.”"
