However, \u201cjury-men\u201d\nwould have done just as well.\n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \u201cWhat are\nthey doing?\u201d Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \u201cThey can\u2019t have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial\u2019s begun.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re putting down their names,\u201d the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n\u201cfor fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\u201d",
