  "scene_text": "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n\n“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and those twelve creatures,”\n(she was obliged to say “creatures,” you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) “I suppose they are the jurors.” She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, “jury-men”\nwould have done just as well.\n\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are\nthey doing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”\n\n“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n“for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.”"
