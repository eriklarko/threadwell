  "scene_text": "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, \u201cNow, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?\u201d when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\n\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \u201cIf it had grown up,\u201d she said to\nherself, \u201cit would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\u201d And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\nto herself, \u201cif one only knew the right way to change them\u2014\u201d when she\nwas a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of\na tree a few yards off.\n\nThe Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\nthought: still it had _very_ long claws and a great many teeth, so she\nfelt that it ought to be treated with respect.",
