I’m a hatter.”\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t be nervous, or I’ll\nhave you executed on the spot.”\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter."
