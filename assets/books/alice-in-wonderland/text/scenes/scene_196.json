I\u2019m a hatter.\u201d\n\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\n\u201cGive your evidence,\u201d said the King; \u201cand don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll\nhave you executed on the spot.\u201d\n\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.",
