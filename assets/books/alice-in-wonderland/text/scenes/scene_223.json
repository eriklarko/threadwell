  "scene_text": "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\nWonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\nwould change to dull reality\u2014the grass would be only rustling in the\nwind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds\u2014the rattling\nteacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill\ncries to the voice of the shepherd boy\u2014and the sneeze of the baby, the\nshriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\n(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard\u2014while the\nlowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\nTurtle\u2019s heavy sobs.\n\nLastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\nwould, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\nkeep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\nchildhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\nand make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\nperhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\nwould feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\ntheir simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\ndays.",
