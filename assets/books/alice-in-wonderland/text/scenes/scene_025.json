I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\na mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”) The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing."
