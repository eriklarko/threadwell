In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\u2014\u201cI wish they\u2019d\nget the trial done,\u201d she thought, \u201cand hand round the refreshments!\u201d\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time.",
