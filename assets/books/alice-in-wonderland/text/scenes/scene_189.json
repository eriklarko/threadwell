In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them—“I wish they’d\nget the trial done,” she thought, “and hand round the refreshments!”\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time."
