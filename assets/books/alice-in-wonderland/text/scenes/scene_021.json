No, I\u2019ve\nmade up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019\nI shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down\nhere till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \u201cI do wish they _would_ put their heads down!
