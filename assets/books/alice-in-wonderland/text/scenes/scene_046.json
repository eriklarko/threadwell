  "scene_text": "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\ncalled out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\ndoing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\na fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\nat once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\nmistake it had made.\n\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow\nsurprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him\nhis fan and gloves\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she\ncame upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\nplate with the name \u201cW. RABBIT,\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without\nknocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\nreal Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\nfan and gloves.",
