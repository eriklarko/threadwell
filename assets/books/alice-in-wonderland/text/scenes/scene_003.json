  "scene_text": "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\nhot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\nmaking a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\npicking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\nclose by her.\n\nThere was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\nso _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh\ndear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards,\nit occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\ntime it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\nwatch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\non, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\nhad never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\nwatch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\nfield after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\nlarge rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\nin the world she was to get out again.",
