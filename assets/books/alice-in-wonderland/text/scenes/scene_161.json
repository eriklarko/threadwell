She\npitied him deeply. “What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing."
