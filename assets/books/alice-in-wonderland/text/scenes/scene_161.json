  "scene_text": "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\nsitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\nnearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\npitied him deeply. \u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201cIt\u2019s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u201d\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.",
