She\npitied him deeply. \u201cWhat is his sorrow?\u201d she asked the Gryphon, and the\nGryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, \u201cIt\u2019s all\nhis fancy, that: he hasn\u2019t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!\u201d\n\nSo they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\nfull of tears, but said nothing.",
