  "scene_text": "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.\n\n\u201cI wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so,\u201d said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. \u201cI can hardly breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said Alice very meekly: \u201cI\u2019m growing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no right to grow _here_,\u201d said the Dormouse.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense,\u201d said Alice more boldly: \u201cyou know you\u2019re growing\ntoo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\u201d said the Dormouse: \u201cnot in\nthat ridiculous fashion.\u201d And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, \u201cBring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u201d\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.",
