  "scene_text": "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.\n\n“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so,” said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. “I can hardly breathe.”\n\n“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’m growing.”\n\n“You’ve no right to grow _here_,” said the Dormouse.\n\n“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “you know you’re growing\ntoo.”\n\n“Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse: “not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.\n\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, “Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!”\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff."
