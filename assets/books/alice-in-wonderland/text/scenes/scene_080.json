Why, I\nhaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”\n\n“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\n“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,” continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”\n\n“But I’m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice. “I’m a—I’m a—”\n\n“Well! _What_ are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can see you’re trying to\ninvent something!”\n\n“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that!
