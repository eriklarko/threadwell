Why, I\nhaven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\n\u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2014I\u2019m a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! _What_ are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to\ninvent something!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n\u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s\nno use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!\u201d",
