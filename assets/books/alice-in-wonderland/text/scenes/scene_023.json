  "scene_text": "“That _was_ a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\nsudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\nnow for the garden!” and she ran with all speed back to the little\ndoor: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden\nkey was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\never,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\nbefore, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\nsplash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that\nshe had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\nrailway,” she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\nher life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\nto on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\nsea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\nof lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she\nsoon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\nshe was nine feet high."
