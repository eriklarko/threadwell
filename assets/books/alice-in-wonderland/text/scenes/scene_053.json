Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!”\n\n“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here! Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_” (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”\n\n“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it “arrum.”)\n\n“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\nwindow!”\n\n“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”"
