  "scene_text": "“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”\n\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\n\n“That’s different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,” said\nthe Gryphon.\n\n“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.”\n\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n\n“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.\n\n“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Go on with the next\nverse.”"
