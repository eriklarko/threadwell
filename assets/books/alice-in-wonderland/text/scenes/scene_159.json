  "scene_text": "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\nto the company generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come, _that’s_ a\ngood thing!” she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\nnumber of executions the Queen had ordered.\n\nThey very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If\nyou don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazy\nthing!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the Mock\nTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\nexecutions I have ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone\nwith the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature,\nbut on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it\nas to go after that savage Queen: so she waited."
