(As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019ve seen that done,\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI\u2019ve so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, \u201cThere was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,\u201d and I never understood what it meant till now.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s all you know about it, you may stand down,\u201d continued the\nKing.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t go no lower,\u201d said the Hatter: \u201cI\u2019m on the floor, as it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you may _sit_ down,\u201d the King replied.\n\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\n\u201cCome, that finished the guinea-pigs!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cNow we shall get\non better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u201d said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.",
