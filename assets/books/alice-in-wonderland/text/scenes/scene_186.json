Sing her ‘_Turtle Soup_,’ will you, old\nfellow?”\n\nThe Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked\nwith sobs, to sing this:—\n\n“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,\nWaiting in a hot tureen!\nWho for such dainties would not stoop?\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\nSoup of the evening, beautiful Soup!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\n    Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!\nSoo—oop of the e—e—evening,\n    Beautiful, beautiful Soup!"
