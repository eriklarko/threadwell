First, however, she\nwaited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\nshe felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d\nsaid Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I\nwonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the\nflame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\nnot remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\ninto the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\ndoor, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\nwent back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\nit: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\nbest to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\nand when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\nsat down and cried.\n\n\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself,\nrather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally\ngave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\nand sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\nher eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\ncheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\nfor this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two\npeople! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\nperson!\u201d",
