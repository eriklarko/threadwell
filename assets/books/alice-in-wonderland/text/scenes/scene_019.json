And yesterday things went on just as usual.\nI wonder if I’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the\nsame when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle!” And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them."
