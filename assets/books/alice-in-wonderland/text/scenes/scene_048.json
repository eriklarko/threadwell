  "scene_text": "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI’ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\ngrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\ndrunk quite so much!”"
