  "scene_text": "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\nin the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\npairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\ngloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\nlittle bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label\nthis time with the words \u201cDRINK ME,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it\nand put it to her lips. \u201cI know _something_ interesting is sure to\nhappen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so\nI\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large\nagain, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\ndrunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\nand had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\ndown the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t\ngrow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t\ndrunk quite so much!\u201d",
