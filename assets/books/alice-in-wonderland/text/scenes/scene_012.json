  "scene_text": "It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\nnot going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\n“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\nseveral nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\neaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\n_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\nsuch as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\nand that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\nbleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\nbottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\nsooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\ntaste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\nflavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\nhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off."
