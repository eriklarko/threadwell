Alice gave a little\nscream of laughter. \u201cOh, hush!\u201d the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\ntone. \u201cThe Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\nQueen said\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cGet to your places!\u201d shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\npeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\nother; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\nbegan. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground\nin her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live\nhedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double\nthemselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.",
