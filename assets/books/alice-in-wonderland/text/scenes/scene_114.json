It\u2019s _him_.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you mean,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cOf course you don\u2019t!\u201d the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \u201cI dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps not,\u201d Alice cautiously replied: \u201cbut I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! that accounts for it,\u201d said the Hatter. \u201cHe won\u2019t stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!\u201d",
