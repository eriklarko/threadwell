It’s _him_.”\n\n“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.\n\n“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”\n\n“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.”\n\n“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’t stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!”"
