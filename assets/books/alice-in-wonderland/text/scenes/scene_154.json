And\nthe moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flock together.’”\n\n“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.\n\n“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way you have of\nputting things!”\n\n“It’s a mineral, I _think_,” said Alice.\n\n“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.’”\n\n“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.”\n\n“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral of that\nis—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or if you’d like it put more\nsimply—‘Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.’”\n\n“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said very politely,\n“if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.”"
