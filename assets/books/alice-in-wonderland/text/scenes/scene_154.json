And\nthe moral of that is\u2014\u2018Birds of a feather flock together.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly mustard isn\u2019t a bird,\u201d Alice remarked.\n\n\u201cRight, as usual,\u201d said the Duchess: \u201cwhat a clear way you have of\nputting things!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a mineral, I _think_,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; \u201cthere\u2019s a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is\u2014\u2018The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I know!\u201d exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, \u201cit\u2019s a vegetable. It doesn\u2019t look like one, but it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cI quite agree with you,\u201d said the Duchess; \u201cand the moral of that\nis\u2014\u2018Be what you would seem to be\u2019\u2014or if you\u2019d like it put more\nsimply\u2014\u2018Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I should understand that better,\u201d Alice said very politely,\n\u201cif I had it written down: but I can\u2019t quite follow it as you say it.\u201d",
