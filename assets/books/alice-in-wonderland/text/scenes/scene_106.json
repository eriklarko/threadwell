  "scene_text": "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of\nthe March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\nchimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\nwas so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\nnibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself\nto about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather\ntimidly, saying to herself \u201cSuppose it should be raving mad after all!\nI almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nA Mad Tea-Party\n\n\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u201cVery\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u201d thought Alice; \u201conly, as it\u2019s asleep,\nI suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u201d",
