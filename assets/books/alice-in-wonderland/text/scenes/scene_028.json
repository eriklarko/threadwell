And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your\npardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk\nabout her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. \u201cAs if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name\nagain!\u201d",
