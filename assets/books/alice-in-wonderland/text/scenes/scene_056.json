I wouldn’t be in\nBill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI _think_ I can kick a little!”\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself “This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next."
