She was\nwalking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n\n“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”\n\n“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\nanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\ntiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under\nsentence of execution.”\n\n“What for?” said Alice.\n\n“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.\n\n“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\n‘What for?’”"
