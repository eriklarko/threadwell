  "scene_text": "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n\n“When _I’m_ a Duchess,” she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), “I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without—Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes\nthem bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn’t be\nso stingy about it, you know—”\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.”\n\n“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.\n\n“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\nshe spoke."
