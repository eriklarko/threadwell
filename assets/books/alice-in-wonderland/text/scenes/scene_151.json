  "scene_text": "Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\nto herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\nsavage when they met in the kitchen.\n\n\u201cWhen _I\u2019m_ a Duchess,\u201d she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful\ntone though), \u201cI won\u2019t have any pepper in my kitchen _at all_. Soup\ndoes very well without\u2014Maybe it\u2019s always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,\u201d she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, \u201cand vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes\nthem bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn\u2019t be\nso stingy about it, you know\u2014\u201d\n\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can\u2019t\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it hasn\u2019t one,\u201d Alice ventured to remark.\n\n\u201cTut, tut, child!\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cEverything\u2019s got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.\u201d And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice\u2019s side as\nshe spoke.",
