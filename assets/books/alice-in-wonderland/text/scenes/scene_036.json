  "scene_text": "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact\nshape doesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, and\naway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, “_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.”\n\n“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n“Why, _she_, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.\n\n“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.\n\n“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else have you got in\nyour pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice."
