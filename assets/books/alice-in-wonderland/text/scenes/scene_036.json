  "scene_text": "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact\nshape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed\nalong the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and\naway,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\nliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\nwhen they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry\nagain, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all\ncrowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\nthought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its\nforehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the\npictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo\nsaid, \u201c_Everybody_ has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, _she_, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one\nfinger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a\nconfused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\npocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\nnot got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly\none a-piece, all round.\n\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in\nyour pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.",
