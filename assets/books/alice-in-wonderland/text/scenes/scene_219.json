There was a dead silence.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pun!\u201d the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, \u201cLet the jury consider their verdict,\u201d the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.\n\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d said the Queen. \u201cSentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff and nonsense!\u201d said Alice loudly. \u201cThe idea of having the\nsentence first!\u201d\n\n\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d said the Queen, turning purple.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cOff with her head!\u201d the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
