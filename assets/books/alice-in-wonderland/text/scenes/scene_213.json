(The jury\nall brightened up again.)\n\n“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t write it, and they\ncan’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.”\n\n“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that only makes the matter\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed\nyour name like an honest man.”\n\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day."
