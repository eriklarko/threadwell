# Audio Playback Architecture

## Library Choice: react-native-track-player

We'll use `react-native-track-player` for audio playback in Threadwell. This library is ideal for audiobook applications because it provides:

- **Background playback support** - Essential for audiobooks as users need continuous playback when switching apps
- **Native audio controls** - Lock screen controls work automatically
- **Queue management** - Built-in support for playlists/chapters
- **Event-based state tracking** - Clean API for monitoring playback progress
- **Cross-platform reliability** - Consistent behavior on iOS and Android

## Implementation Approach

We'll implement audio playback using a custom React hook pattern (`useAudioPlayer`) that encapsulates all track player logic. This provides a clean, reusable interface for components while handling the complexity of audio state management, player setup, and cleanup. The hook will manage player initialization, track loading, playback controls (play/pause/seek), and progress tracking, making it easy to add audio functionality to any screen in the app.
