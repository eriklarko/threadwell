### Epic 1: Finding Our Story - Content & Data

*   **What is it?** We need a book to work with! We'll find a good story that is free to use (in the public domain) and has an existing audiobook version. We'll look for a popular one with lots of reviews and information available, which will help us test our app's features accurately.
*   **Why do it first?** All of our app's smart features depend on having a book's text and audio. The choice of content will also influence our design.
*   **What we'll get:** A chosen book and its audio files, ready for the app.
