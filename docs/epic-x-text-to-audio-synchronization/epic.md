### Epic X: Text-to-Audio Synchronization

*   **What is it?** This epic covers the creation of a system to automatically synchronize audiobook text with its corresponding audio. This is a core component of the app's smart features.
*   **Why do it?** If we cannot find a book with pre-existing synchronization data, we will need to build this capability ourselves. This epic serves as a placeholder for that work.
*   **What we'll get:** A tool or process that takes an audiobook and its text as input, and produces a file that maps words in the text to timestamps in the audio.

## üîç Research Findings - Existing Solutions Available!

**Good News:** We don't need to build this from scratch! During Epic 1 research, we discovered mature, open-source solutions that can handle our synchronization needs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Primary Solution: syncabook Toolchain

**syncabook** - A complete pipeline for creating synchronized audiobooks:
- **Input:** Plain text + Audio files (perfect for Project Gutenberg + LibriVox)
- **Process:** Automated forced alignment using DTW (Dynamic Time Warping)
- **Output:** EPUB3 with Media Overlays (industry standard format)
- **Status:** Actively maintained, production-ready
- **Repository:** https://github.com/r4victor/syncabook

**Key Features:**
- Automatic text-to-speech synthesis for alignment reference
- DTW algorithm for precise timing alignment
- Handles various audio formats (MP3, WAV)
- Produces word-level and phrase-level timestamps
- Integrated with LibriVox workflow

### üéØ Core Technology: afaligner

**afaligner** - The forced alignment engine:
- **Algorithm:** Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based alignment
- **Process:**
  1. Synthesizes reference audio from text using TTS
  2. Aligns synthesized audio with recorded audio
  3. Maps alignment back to original text
- **Accuracy:** Designed specifically for audiobook alignment
- **Repository:** https://github.com/r4victor/afaligner

### üì¶ Ready-Made Data: synclibrivox

**synclibrivox** - Pre-synchronized LibriVox recordings:
- **Content:** Collection of already-synchronized popular audiobooks
- **Format:** SMIL files (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language)
- **Usage:** Direct integration with syncabook
- **Repository:** https://github.com/r4victor/synclibrivox

### üîß Alternative Tools Discovered

**Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA):**
- Research-grade tool using Kaldi
- More complex setup but higher precision
- Used in academic/professional contexts

**echogarden:**
- Cross-platform speech toolset
- Node.js based
- Includes forced alignment capabilities

**DSAlign (Mozilla):**
- DeepSpeech-based forced alignment
- Good for high-accuracy requirements

### üìã Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Use Existing Solutions**
1. **Start with syncabook** for immediate needs
2. **Leverage synclibrivox** for pre-made sync data when available
3. **Generate custom sync data** using syncabook + afaligner for our chosen book

**Phase 2: Integration (Future)**
1. **Extract timing data** from EPUB3 Media Overlays
2. **Convert to app-friendly format** (JSON with word/phrase timestamps)
3. **Optimize for mobile performance** (lightweight data structures)

**Phase 3: Custom Optimization (Future)**
1. **Fine-tune alignment** for app-specific needs (paragraph boundaries, scene breaks)
2. **Add semantic markers** for character dialogue, scene changes
3. **Integrate with app features** (Smart Rewind, Scene Navigation)

### üéØ Immediate Action Plan

**For Current Project:**
1. ‚úÖ **Tool Selection:** Use syncabook (proven, LibriVox-compatible)
2. ‚úÖ **Data Source:** Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (confirmed available)
3. ‚úÖ **Process:** Project Gutenberg text + LibriVox audio ‚Üí syncabook ‚Üí SMIL/EPUB3
4. ‚úÖ **Integration:** Extract timing data for app development
