### Epic 4: Just the Basics - Simple Audio Playback

*   **What is it?** We'll turn our basic app into a simple audiobook player. It will have the standard controls: play, pause, and a slider to move through the track.
*   **Why do it now?** This is the core function of any audiobook app. We need to make sure this works perfectly before adding our special features.
*   **What we'll get:** A screen in the app that can play our chosen audiobook.
