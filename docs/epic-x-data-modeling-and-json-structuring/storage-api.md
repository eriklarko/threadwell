# Storage API Design: Facade Pattern

## Objective
To define a clean and flexible API for data storage within the Threadwell application, enabling seamless switching between local and remote storage mechanisms in the future without impacting the core application logic. This will be achieved by implementing the Facade pattern.

## Facade Pattern Overview
The Facade pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. In our case, the storage facade will abstract away the complexities of different storage implementations (e.g., local filesystem, SQLite, cloud database, etc.).

## Core Principles
*   **Abstraction:** The application interacts only with the `StorageFacade` interface, unaware of the underlying storage technology.
*   **Flexibility:** New storage implementations can be added or existing ones swapped out with minimal changes to the application code.
*   **Testability:** The facade makes it easier to test storage-related logic by allowing mock implementations.

## Proposed API (Conceptual)

```typescript
interface BookStorage {
    saveBook(bookId: string, data: BookData): Promise<void>;
    getBook(bookId: string): Promise<BookData | null>;
    deleteBook(bookId: string): Promise<void>;
    listBooks(): Promise<BookData[]>;

    saveProgress(bookId: string, progress: UserProgress): Promise<void>;
    getProgress(bookId: string): Promise<UserProgress | null>;
}

/**
 * deals with settings that are local to a device
 */
interface DeviceSettings {
    saveSetting(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
    getSetting(key: string): Promise<any | null>;
}

/**
 * deals with settings that are shared across devices
 */
interface UserSettings {
    saveSetting(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
    getSetting(key: string): Promise<any | null>;
}

interface StorageFacade extends BookStorage, UserStorage {}

// Example Data Structures (to be defined in detail later)
interface BookData { /* ... */ }
interface UserProgress { /* ... */ }
```

## Initial Implementation (Local Storage)
For the initial phase, the `StorageFacade` will be implemented using local device storage (e.g., React Native's AsyncStorage, or plain file system storage for larger assets). This implementation will adhere to the `StorageFacade` interface.

## Future Considerations
*   **Remote Storage:** When cloud sync is introduced, a new implementation of `StorageFacade` (e.g., `CloudStorageFacade`) can be developed and swapped in.
*   **Data Migration:** A strategy for migrating data between different storage implementations will be required when switching.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms will be built into the facade to manage storage failures gracefully.
