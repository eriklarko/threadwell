### Epic 6: Data Modeling and JSON Structuring

*   **What is it?** This epic is about defining the data structure for our books and then processing our chosen book into that format. It's a critical step for enabling the app's smart features.
*   **Why do it?** A well-defined data model is the foundation for features like "who's in this scene?" and character histories. We need a consistent and predictable way to access the book's content.
*   **What we'll get:**
    1.  A clear document defining the JSON schema for our books.
    2.  A script or process that converts a plain text book into this structured JSON format.
    3.  The structured JSON file for our chosen book.
