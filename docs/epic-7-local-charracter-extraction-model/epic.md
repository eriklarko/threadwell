I want to use a local model to extract characters from a scene. I'm hoping to use DSPy to train a small language model to do this. This epic is about giving that a try.

requirements:

0. research how to train a small language model with DSPy
1. build a dataset of 500 scenes and characters
2. research small language models to use
3. train model
