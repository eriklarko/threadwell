We're building the now playing screen described in docs/epic-2-ui-sketch/now-playing-screen.

Project details are in docs/project-scope.md.

Implementation instructions are in app/copilot-guidelines.md


Let's start by breaking down the screen into multiple steps
1. basic view just showing the cover art, title and author
2. then we'll add a basic audio player, just play/pause - DONE!
3. audio controls; skip back 5s, skip forward 5s - DONE!
4. progress bar showing how much of the audio file is left - DONE!
5. ensure progress bar shows file duration on load - DONE!
6. Stub out Who's Here.
7. add chat button that does nothing
