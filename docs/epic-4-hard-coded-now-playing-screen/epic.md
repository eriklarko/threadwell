We're building the now playing screen described in docs/epic-2-ui-sketch/now-playing-screen.

Project details are in docs/project-scope.md.

Implementation instructions are in app/copilot-guidelines.md


Let's start by breaking down the screen into multiple steps
1. basic view just showing the cover art, title and author
2. then we'll add a basic audio player, just play/pause
3. audio controls; skip back 5s, skip forward 5s
4. progress bar showing how much of the audio file is left
5. Stub out Who's Here trigger; need to design this still
6. add chat button that does nothing
