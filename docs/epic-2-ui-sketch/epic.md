### Epic 2: The Blueprint - UI/UX Design

*   **What is it?** We'll sketch out what the app will look like and how users will interact with it. This includes the main player screen, the library, and the chat interface.
*   **Why do it now?** Having a design plan before writing any code will make development much smoother. It's like having a blueprint before you start building a house.
*   **What we'll get:** A set of drawings or mockups that show what the app will look like, organized by screen in their respective directories.
