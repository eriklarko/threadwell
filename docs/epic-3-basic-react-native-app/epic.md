### Epic 3: The Foundation - A Basic App

*   **What is it?** This is the skeleton of our app. We'll set up a new React Native project from scratch, based on our design.
*   **Why do it now?** With the design complete, we can create the basic structure of the app to match it. This gives us a solid starting point to add all the cool features later.
*   **What we'll get:** A blank mobile app that opens on a screen, with the basic navigation and layout from our design.
